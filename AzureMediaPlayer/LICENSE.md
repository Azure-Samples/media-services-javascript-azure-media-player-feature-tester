# MICROSOFT PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS #
## MICROSOFT AZURE MEDIA PLAYER  ##
These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the pre-release software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft

- updates,
- supplements,
- Internet-based services, and
- support services

for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.

**By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software.**


----------


**If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.**


1. **INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.** 

	**a. Installation and Use.**

	- You may install and use any number of copies of the software on your devices.  
	- You may deploy your applications that include the software for commercial purposes only on the following conditions:

		1.	You are fully responsible for any and all damages that may result due to any failure of the software;
		2.	You must notify all recipients that your applications include pre-release, time-limited, unsupported software that may not operate correctly;
		3.	You may not make any representation, warranty or promise on behalf of Microsoft or with respect to the software or its performance;
		4.	Your applications that deliver, receive, playback or otherwise handle video or audio content must use Azure Media Services in the content delivery chain; and
		5.	Notwithstanding Section 2 'Term' of this agreement, within 30 days after Microsoft releases a commercial version of the software, you will discontinue using the pre-release version and offering your application(s) for use with the pre-release version.  You may, however, upgrade your application(s) to use the commercial release version pursuant to the Microsoft license terms accompanying such commercially released version.
		
	**b.	Included Microsoft Programs.** The software contains other Microsoft programs. These license terms apply to your use of those programs.

	**c.	Third Party Programs.** The software may include third party programs that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement. Notices for the third party programs are included for your information only.  Scroll down to read the notices.

	**d.	Third Party Notices.**  Third party scripts, linked to, called or referenced from the software, are licensed to you by the third parties that own such code, not by Microsoft, see Microsoft Azure Terms of Use http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/.

2.	**TERM.** The term of this agreement is until 30/06/2015 (day/month/year), or commercial release of the software, whichever is first.

3.	**PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.** This software is a pre-release version. It may not work the way a final version of the software will. We may change it for the final, commercial version. We also may not release a commercial version.

4.	**FEEDBACK.** If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You also give to third parties, without charge, any patent rights needed for their products, technologies and services to use or interface with any specific parts of a Microsoft software or service that includes the feedback. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because we include your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.

5.	**SCOPE OF LICENSE.** The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
	- work around any technical limitations in the software;
	- reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;
	- publish the software for others to copy;
	- rent, lease or lend the software;
	- transfer the software or this agreement to any third party; or
	- use the software for commercial software hosting services. 


6.	**EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.** The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.

7.	**SUPPORT SERVICES.** Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it.

8.	**ENTIRE AGREEMENT.** This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

9.	**APPLICABLE LAW.**

	**a.	United States.** If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.

	**b.	Outside the United States.** If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.

10.	**LEGAL EFFECT.** This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.

11.	**DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed “as-is.” You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights or statutory guarantees under your local laws which this agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.**

	**FOR AUSTRALIA – You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in these terms is intended to affect those rights.**

12.	**LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.**
	This limitation applies to

	- anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
	- claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

	It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

**Please note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.**

**EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE.** Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril. Microsoft n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier de droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon sont exclues.

**LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES DOMMAGES.** Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de bénéfices.

Cette limitation concerne :

- tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes tiers ; et

Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.

**EFFET JURIDIQUE.** Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.
